# Neural-network-BBC-news-reports

In this project i have tokenized words from the BBC news reports dataset. 
This dataset contains articles that are classified into a number of different categories. 
I have design a neural network that can accurately determine what words determine what category. 
The neural network is tarined with 30 epochs.
